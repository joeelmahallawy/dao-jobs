# DaoJobz [demo](https://www.daojobz.xyz/)

## Problem

As the rise of DeFi continues, we find ourselves moving further away from traditional centralized businesses, and closer to *decentralized* businesses which are driven by autonomy and democracy. An organization that is focused on decentralized governance and power to the people– where everyone under the organization has *right to vote.* These self-governed structures are called DAOs (Decentralized autonomous organization).

DAOs are the first appearance of *crypto salaries*, people work full-time jobs for DAOs and get compensated in crypto, whether it be Bitcoin or the DAOs community token. We’re moving at a velocity that we can’t even measure yet, and it’s just gets bigger from here, especially due to our inflationary dollar. 

Since DAOs are an organization, they still require people to contribute to the DAO, and essentially *work at a Dao*. This is where DaoJobz comes into play.

## Solution

DaoJobz is a job board for people to work at a DAO while also remaining anonymous by authenticating the user through Discord. Discord authentication was used since most DAO communities exist on Discord, and because Discord allows full user interaction while remaining anonymous. 

There’s two types of users; employers and job seekers. Here’s what both users interaction with DaoJobz would look like.

 **Employers**

- Log in with Discord
- Register your DAO by entering in some basic information about your DAO
- Start adding job postings
- Hire employees!

**Job Seekers**

- Log in with Discord
- See all available job postings and Daos that are hiring
- Apply to your favourite DAO
- Start working for a DAO!
