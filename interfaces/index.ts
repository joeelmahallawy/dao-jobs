// You can include shared interfaces/types in a separate file
// and then use them in any component by importing them. For
// example, to import the interface below do:
//
// import { User } from 'path/to/interfaces';

export type User = {
    id: number
    name: string
}
// hey, why do we need to verify it on the client-side ?
// why do we need it?
//
// hmm wait one sec
// so that we can keep the user logged in// nope, if they refresh the page, they wont be sure

// bro

// you mean the chat on here right?
